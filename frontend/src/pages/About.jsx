            <strong>Smart Farming Platform</strong> is an AI-powered web
            application designed to support farmers in making better and smarter
            agricultural decisions. The platform primarily focuses on{" "}
            <strong>crop disease detection</strong> using deep learning
            techniques, allowing farmers to simply upload leaf images for
            accurate disease identification. Once a disease is detected, the
            system suggests suitable <strong>remedies and solutions</strong> to
            protect crops and prevent yield loss.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-4">
            In addition to disease detection, the platform enables farmers to{" "}
            <strong>manage their own products</strong> with features to{" "}
            <strong>add, edit, and delete listings</strong>. Other farmers or
            users can view these product listings, encouraging knowledge sharing
            and collaboration within the farming community.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-4">
            The platform is built with simplicity and accessibility in mind â€” it
            has only <strong>users</strong> (no admin role) to keep interactions
            straightforward and farmer-friendly.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-4">
            Our mission is to <strong>empower farmers</strong> with AI-driven
            tools that improve crop health, reduce losses, and enhance
            productivity, creating a sustainable and efficient agricultural
            ecosystem.
